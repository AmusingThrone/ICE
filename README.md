# ICE

ICE is a handcrafted modern theme for Club Penguin Private Servers. ICE is licensed under the [Creative Commons Attributions](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode). That means you can use it in both Commercial and Non-Commercial projects for free, but you must give me credit.

 ICE comes with a Home, Register, and Play page along with mobile support.

 Currently ICE is under development, and is the primary theme for my CPPS-Maker script, which is planned to be released in late July.

If you are interested in how to setup a CPPS using Kitsune, you can check out [my tool here](https://github.com/AmusingThrone/kitsune-auto-setup/).
